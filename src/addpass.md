# Adding passwords

Go to the pass.py file in your selected ide, then go and add your sit/program name of the password (e.g youtube) in the psw_print list, then put the real password in the psw_real list. ()

After that copy the if statment at the start and change

- The name of the password in the ```if psw_choice == "The site name "```
- The password number in the list (Remember that it starts in 0)
- And than the name of the site at the end
